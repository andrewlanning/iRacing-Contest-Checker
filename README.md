# iRacing-Contest-Checker
Checks your eligibility for contests each season.

Quick and dirty script to check contest eligibility. Very early in development!! There may be bugs!

Questions, Comments, Feature Suggestions and Bugs please report to lanningsimulation@gmail.com

Ultimately comes with a few caveats:
Contests must be manually input into contests.json. (I've already done this for 22S4.)
Until a hook is placed for a sponsor list in the API, Sponsor list must be manually updated.



HOW TO USE:

Input your user information to credentials.py and run main.py!

If you integrate this code, please provide credit :)

KNOWN ISSUES:
10-29-2022 : Currently not checking for 50% race completion.
